		<h2>Programming bootcamp</h2>
	</div>

	<div class="pbinfo"
		<p>Those are some of the tasks I did, at the programming bootcamp at school. 
		All of are mini games. I didn't code at all before starting the course but after the programming bootcamp
		I decided to try and learn as much as I can. The games are very simple and most people are familiar with, if not they are extremely easy to play and understand. For the majority 
		of my life I'be been loving games not only digital games but card board games card games and even strategical and knowledge games such as chess and crosswords. So 
		the first game is a game known as pong and it uses the mouse movement. You control the bat with your mouse and the goal is to bounce back the ball to the wall as many times as possible.
		The second Green game is about a black sphere that chaces the small square which moves with random speed and to random directions. The movement of the sphere is done with arrow keys on keyboard.
		The last game is the last day project where we all had to make something using our gained knowledge throuout the week. I made a bouncy game and called it bouncy boi. The goal is to hit 100 score 
		with the shortest amount of time. Controlls are with the mouse movement and with left click the ball avatar jumps there is collision on the ground which makes it bounce back using gravity.</p>
