	<h1>Education</h1>
	<p>I attended highschool in Greece, on a island called Crete. In the province of Chania, I went to a school which was about 7km from my house. We lived in a seaside village where the population is around a thousand people. I graduated from highschool in 2016 with a 16.8/20. Right now I am studying UX design in The Netherlands #++.  </p>
