	<h4>I attended highschool in Greece, on a island called Crete. In the province of Chania, I went to a school which was about 7km from my house. We lived in a seaside village where the population is around a thousand people. 
		I graduated from highschool in 2016 with a 16.8/20. Right now I am studying UX design in The Netherlands. I am able to speak 5 languages in total and 3 of them to a good 
		extend. The languages I speak are , Greek,  Bulgarian, English, Spanish and Romanian. Due to my upbringing in Greece my Greek is my best language followed by Bulgarian which is my 
		mother language, I studied English in School and I learnt Spanish to a communicational level from the time I spent in Madrid which was about 2 years. </h4>
