                    <h3>Project Description:</h3>
                    <p> Card personalisation tool. Creating our own Card personalisation tool was one of the hardest projects I've had so far. The project was devided into 2 parts
                    and it was a group project of 2 people. I will speak only about the second part here but the first part of the project can be found bellow. This is the Card 
                    personalisation tool I've come up with based on the information and situation for our persona. Persona can be found also bellow. </p>

                    <p>
                        The card personalisation tool is designed for Karen and her loved ones. Karen is someone who doesn't like intangible gifts but loves giving gifts to her  
                        family and loved ones. Furthermore, She doesn't like gifts which are materialistic and impersonal but rather she loves gifts which are memorable and full
                        of experiences. The user can choose from having 3 different style cards. The first one being the Picture book.
                        The picture book basically is a online picture album but more interactive and modern. The Musical card is an addition because karen's biggest hobby is playing the 
                        guitar. She learnt how to do so from her father and she loves listening to him play. Therefore, I made this card for exactly that. With the musical card the user is able to
                        send a recording of their choice and have it play upon the opening of the card. Last but not least is the puzzle card option. This is exactly what it says it is. It's a puzzle but the 
                        puzzle is meant to be a memorable moment such as a happy family photograph on a vacationn. The idea is to solve the puzzle and only then the emotional message will be conveyed to the receiver.
