<h1> Work Experience </h1>
</div>

<section class="details">
	My work experience varies in different sectors. I have been working from the age of 14 in the restaurant business, things like dish washing, waiter and chef assistant. Due to the high tourism in the place I grew up I was working summer jobs which most had to do with restaurants or beaches. Although I am currently studying UXD I don't have any experience in that sector. UXD is interesting to study and hopefully I can work in that environment.</section>
